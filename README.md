# OUA-BLOCKCHAIN-
The official GitHub repository for the OUA Blockchain. We are building a platform for Pan-African governance, economic sovereignty, and self-sovereign digital identity (OUA-ID). This project features core smart contracts for the BOJ Token and a Validator DAO, aligning with the vision to decentralize Africa's future.
OUA Blockchain
Decentralizing Africa's Future
The OUA Blockchain is a visionary initiative to build a Pan-African governance ecosystem powered by blockchain technology. Our mission is to unify digital identity, foster economic sovereignty, and create a transparent, borderless framework for trade and collaboration across the continent.
This repository contains the core smart contracts and foundational code that power the OUA ecosystem, designed for security, scalability, and long-term sustainability.
Key Features
 * OUA-ID: A non-transferable, verifiable digital identity (ERC-721 NFT) for citizens, enabling seamless access to services and borderless travel.
 * BOJ Token: An ERC-20 utility and governance token with a fixed supply, designed to facilitate intra-African trade and power the ecosystem.
 * Validator Governance DAO: A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that uses stake-weighted voting to empower validators and ensure transparent, community-driven decision-making.
 * Ecosystem Contracts: Frameworks for applications like OUA-EduChain (verifiable academic credentials) and OUA-HealthChain (unified, privacy-preserving medical records).
Getting Started (For Developers)
This project uses Hardhat, a professional Ethereum development environment. To set up the project locally and interact with the smart contracts, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/oua-blockchain.git
cd oua-blockchain

2. Install dependencies:
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
npm install

3. Compile the smart contracts:
npx hardhat compile

4. Run tests:
To ensure everything is working correctly, run the test suite.
npx hardhat test

Roadmap
 * Phase 1: Pilot & Launch (Q4 2025)
   * Launch the OUA-ID and BOJ smart contracts on a testnet.
   * Conduct the OUA-ID rollout in Kenya and Uganda for pilot testing.
 * Phase 2: Growth & Onboarding (Q1 2026)
   * Conduct a token airdrop and launch the Validator DAO.
   * Begin onboarding key African technology partners as network validators.
 * Phase 3: Scale & Full Ecosystem (Q3 2026)
   * Deploy the full OUA-HealthChain and OUA-EduChain stack.
   * Integrate with AfCFTA-aligned trade and governance protocols.
