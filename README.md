# OUA-BLOCKCHAIN-
The official GitHub repository for the OUA Blockchain. We are building a platform for Pan-African governance, economic sovereignty, and self-sovereign digital identity (OUA-ID). This project features core smart contracts for the BOJ Token and a Validator DAO, aligning with the vision to decentralize Africa's future.
